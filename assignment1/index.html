							<h2>DAOST Chapter 2 Questions</h2>
							<a href="#" class="button alt" style="margin-bottom: 50px">Back To Top</a>
							<h3>Purpose of a jitter plot.</h3>

							<p>
								The purpose of a jitter plot is to separate data-sets that occupies the same space. By doing this we get a better view of how much of the data occupies the same space. There is no correlation between the distance of the points on the y-axis.
							</p>

							<h3>The purpose of figure 2-3</h3>
							<p>
								Figure 2-3 from <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596802363.do">DAOST</a> - shown below - illustrates two different historams visualizing the same (relatively small) dataset.
							</p>

							<img src="/assignment1/images/fig23.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/>

							<p>
								The purpose of this figure is to show that no two histograms are created equal: When working with small data sets, not only do we need to carefully consider how many bins the histogram is constructed with, but also how the bins are alligned on the x-axis.<br />
								Small data sets are prone to being skewed by bin allignment especially with non-gaussian distribution. The figure caption might as well be <i>how not to histogram.</i>
							</p>

							<h3>When can KDEs be misleading?</h3>

							<p>
								Kernel Density Estimates (KDEs) are conceivably better than histograms at representing and retaining the integrity of certain data sets. Handling outliers, lack of bin size / allignement and unabridged representation gives them an advantage over histograms in many cases.
							</p>

							<img src="/assignment1/images/fig24.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/>

							<p>
								However, KDEs have some disadvantage which can be seen above on figure 2-4. The data, which shows the distribution of US presidents' time-in-office durations, uses two KDE's with different bandwidths on top of the histogram. The issue with this KDE visualization, is that the number of occurences is pracically impossible to read off the graph with a human eye.
							</p>

							<p>
								Small, sparse, discrete and volatile data-sets such as the presidency data are espeically bad for KDE representation and can be very misleading. A peak exists between 40 and 50 months of presidency, however the number of presidents that stayed in office for that duration could be misread to approximately 7, where the true value is 14.
							</p>

							<h3>CDF weaknesses</h3>

							<p>
								Cumulative Density Functions (CDFs) are useful in with other graphs as can be seen below in figure 2-7. The interquartile ranges can easily be estimated using the CDF however statistics such as mean, median and mode are much harder to read of a CDF.
							</p>

							<img src="/assignment1/images/fig27.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/>

							<h3>Quantile plots.</h3>

							Quantile plots, are essentially x-y inverted CDF plots. They focus more on the quartiles/percentile distribution.

							<h3>Probablity Plots</h3>

							<p>
								A probablity plot is constructed by plotting a supposedly Gaussian distributed data-set transformed through the inverse of the Guassian distribution function which it supposedly follows.
								<br />
								If the data follows the distribution perfectly, we should expect to see a straight line where the gradient is the standard deviation and the zero intercept a Mu. Any deviations from the Guassian distribution will be clearly visible.
								<br />
								I've personally never seen one before.
							</p>

							<h3>Summary statistics: Mean, median and more.</h3>
							<p>
								Just like anything in life we have to be context-aware - this is especially true in the data visualization. Don't bring a knife to a gunfight and don't use median price of a company's stock to say too much about the company itself.
								<br />
								Similiarly Janert notes that when dealing with symmetric single peak data with few outliers, the mean and standard deviation are useful describers. However, the fewest data sets have all of these properties and therefore these statistics should rarely be used.
								<br />
								On the other hand summary statistics such as median, quantiles and percentiles deal better with noisey and asymetric data and still tell us just as much - if note more - about the distribution. On the downside, they can be abstract and vague when trying to connect make assumption about the data.
							</p>

							<h3>Box plots</h3>
							<p>
								Box plots packs median, interquartile ranges, upper / lower adjacent data points and - arguably most usefully - outliers. No other plots visualize outliers as explicitly as box plots.
							</p>

							<h3>The book doesn't mention violin plots. Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?</h3>

							<p>
								The violin chart from <a href="https://blog.modeanalytics.com/violin-plot-examples/">mode analytics</a> shows how the weight of baby chicks depends on different types of feed. The plot is relatively simple considering how much data it actually represents:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Two sexes
									</li>
									<li>
										Six distinct types of feed
									</li>
									<li>
										Continous distributions for each combination of sex and feed.
									</li>
									<li>
										Box plot statistics
									</li>
								</ul>

			            <ul>
			                <li>Looking at Fig 3-1, Janert writes "the data itself shows clearly that the amount of random noise in the data is small". What do you think his argument is?</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>Janert's argument: <cite>"... the data points fall on a relatively smooth curve, and we can have confidence that it represents the data accurately."</cite>
			                            The data points have very little deviation from the underlying curve, which means little random noise in the positions of the data points.</li>
			                    </ul>
			                <li>Can you think of a real-world example of a multivariate relationship like the one in Fig 3-3 (lower right panel)?</li>

			                        <li><i>Weighted splines</i></li>

			                    </ol>
			                <li>What are residuals? Why is it a good idea to plot the residuals of your fit?</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>The residuals are difference between the true target values and the approximations. I.e. the error.
			                        It is a good idea to plot the residuals to see if:</li>
			                            <ul>
			                                <li>the residuals are symmetrically distributed around zero.</li>
			                                <li>the residuals are free of trend or structure. If there is a trend in the residuals, it suggests that the model fails to capture some information.</li>
			                                <li>the residuals have constant variance and a mean around zero.</li>
			                                <li>the residuals are normally distributed.</li>
			                            </ul>

			                <li>Explain in your own words the point of the smooth tube in figure 3-7.</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>The <i>"smooth tube"</i> functions as a confidence interval along the approximation curve.
			                            At the same time it illustrates intervals along the curve where the residuals are large.</li>
			                    </ul>
			                <li>What kind of relationships will a semi-log plot help you discover?</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>...</li>
			                    </ul>

			                <li>What the h#ll is banking and what element from our visual system does it use to help us see patterns? What are potential problems with banking?</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>Banking is a transformation that is not applied to the data, but to the plots themselves by changing the aspect ratio. The purpose is to make <i>changes</i> and curves more recognizeable.
			                            It does this by appealing to humans affinity of proportions of 4 by 3. Problems occur when the banking makes the aspect ratio too skewed, or when the banking makes
			                            the plot lose too much detail by shrinking the axes.</li>
			                    </ul>
			                <li>I think figure 3-14 makes an important point about linear fits that is rarely made. What is it?</li>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li>...</li>
			                    </ul>
			                <li>Summarize the discussion of Graphical Analysis and Presentation Graphics on pp. 68-69 in your own words.</li>

								The visualization to the right shows the distrubution of Farmer's produce over a unspecified year.
								The buttons above the visualization control's which produce category to show.
								<br>
								It is easy to observe that fresh produce peaks in the mid-summer to fall seasons, i.e. July to Oktober.
								What is interesting to observe, is that the storage produce peak inverse to fresh produce.
								Storage produce peaks in the winter while being all time low in the mid-summer to fall.
								This is not surprising, as there is no reason to storage produce in the mid-summer to fall seasons
								when fresh produce is ready to be sold instead.

								The visualization to the right is a scatter plot the Boston Marathon winning times for men and women. The winning times are quantified in minutes.
								The buttons allows filtering between men and women, while the lines are a linear fit of the winning times.
								<br>
								What stands out the most is that men were allowed to compete much earlier than women, hence the men goes back to year 1897
								while women begins around 1968. Secondly, it is clear that men on average are faster than women.
